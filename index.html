            <h3>How did we think of the channel</h3>
            <br>
            <p>On June 3rd of 2021 three of us were thinking of something and exciting to do...Hmmmm after a lot of thinking I thought of doing something we are expert in PROGRAMMING (Python) and then after a second everyone agreed and we started the channel...(with not ANY MICHROPHONE OR ANY FANCY THING) it was a bumpy ride slowly we developed and BOOM our channel is here </p>
